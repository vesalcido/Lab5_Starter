1. Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
   - I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because unit tests are said to not be able to see how these individual components interact with eachother on a application/feature level.
2. Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
   - I would use a unit test for the "max message length" test feature because we are just debugging on a small scale without many moving parts. In other words, this can be tested independently of the rest of the application, without requiring interaction with the user interface.
